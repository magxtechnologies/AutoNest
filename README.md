## Introduction

Egg incubation is a crucial process for hatching various avian species, and maintaining precise environmental conditions is essential for successful results. AutoNest aims to simplify and automate this process by leveraging cutting-edge technology to create an intelligent and user-friendly egg incubator control system.

## Features

- **Automatic Temperature and Humidity Control:** AutoNest uses advanced sensors and algorithms to regulate temperature and humidity within the incubator, providing the optimal environment for egg development.

- **Automatic Ventilation Control:** Proper air circulation is crucial for healthy embryo development. The system automatically manages ventilation to ensure a continuous supply of fresh air.

- **Temperature and Humidity Band Analyzer:** AutoNest continuously analyzes temperature and humidity data, providing insights into their trends and patterns.

- **Rate of Change Tracker:** The system tracks the rate of temperature and humidity changes, detecting any sudden fluctuations that may impact the hatching process.

- **Alarm Management System:** AutoNest features a comprehensive alarm system that promptly notifies users of any abnormal conditions, allowing for immediate intervention.
